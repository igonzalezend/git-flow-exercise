## Ingredients

- 500 g lamb mince
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp ground coriander
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp chilli powder
- 1 lemon
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 cucumber
- 6 radishes
- 1 carrot, peeled
- 4 large white tortilla wraps
- 50 g natural yoghurt
- 1 tbsp sumac

## Instructions

1. Place the lamb mince and spices into a mixing bowl. Zest in the lemon (save the rest to juice later), season well with salt and pepper and mix everything together. Roll into rough cylinder shapes and put a frying pan over a high heat. Pour in the oil and add the lamb. Cook for 10 minutes over a medium heat, turning regularly until deep brown all over. 
2. Meanwhile, use the thin slicing disc attachment of a Compact Food Processor to slice the cucumber and radishes. Use the coarse grating disc to grate the carrot. Warm the wraps in a microwave for 10 seconds and tear up the lamb into each wrap. Pile on the prepared salad and drizzle the yoghurt over. Squeeze over a little lemon juice and season with salt, pepper and a generous amount of sumac. Serves 4.
